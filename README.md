# Pand-Aid

## Purpose

### Basic functionality
Pand-Aid is a simple tool that does the following:

1. It aggregates data on the supply needs of immunocompromised and elderly individuals and places them in a secure central database. In the future this may include the needs of people who are currently or potentially ill with Covid-19 along with data on the symptoms they are presenting with.

2. It allows for NPOs, medical facilities, and government bodies to filter and "checkout" groups of individuals based on things like need-type and location. 

3. Once any indivudual or group of needs are met, it is checked off, a confirmation email sent to the at risk individual (just in case they were mistakenly removed) and that particular need or set of needs is removed from any and all instances in the database. 

### Health education and volunteer health safety training steps
In addition to the above the web-app will provide guidelines supported by our best professionals on how to train volunteers in pick up and delivery of items in order to reduce risk of accidental exposure as much as possible. 

On the client side there will be information on steps individuals can take to maintain their own safety as well as emergency phone numbers and other pertinent information. 

## Summary
This tool is meant to allow multiple organizations to spread the workload of responding to our vulnerable populations in an organized fashion and avoid duplication of work. In addition it aims to maintain health safety standards that may be difficult to train for in a purely volunteer "sign up sheet" type format (for example, people in need post their need and volunteers deliver).
